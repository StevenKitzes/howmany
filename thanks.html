		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>I'm grateful to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants.
		I'm proud of the work I've done on the ideas and program logic seen on the H.M.D.I.T.D. site,
		but it would be ugly as sin without the glorious UI features made possible by the Twitter
		Bootstrap team.  They are unbelievably generous to share their work as open source, empowering
		hobbyists like me to make sites that look pretty darn good.</p>
		<a href='http://www.brad21.org'><h4 class='pill'><strong class='color-main-dark'>B.R.A.D.</strong><sup><strong><em>21</em></strong></sup></h4></a>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>The tragic death of Bradley McCue from alcohol poisoning led to
		the development of the <em>Be Responsible About Drinking</em> organization, dedicated to helping
		people avoid the dangers of alcohol abuse.  H.M.D.I.T.D. was created in the same spirit, to help
		us stay mindful of what we're doing when we turn to alcohol for fun or relaxation.  I
		don't celebrate the sad events that caused B.R.A.D.<sup><em>21</em></sup> to be created, but the
		information they've shared was invaluable during my research for this project, and I'm thankful
		to have found it.</p>
		<a href='https://twitter.com/buildstarted'><h4 class='pill'>Ben <strong class='color-main-dark'>Dornis</strong></h4></a>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>Ben has been my friend and a solid mentor for many years.
		Without his constant encouragement and support, I would not have been able to give the effort
		needed to reach the level I stand at today.  We don't see each other often enough, but I'm
		always grateful for the chats and insight we're able to share online.  Thanks, Ben!</p>
