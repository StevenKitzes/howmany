		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>As the craft beer movement has taken off in recent years, and breweries have begun producing
		beers of wildly varying bottle sizes and ABV percentages, I got to wondering what exactly it meant
		when someone - myself included - talked about having "a beer."  You always hear people say that, but what does it mean?
		How does our idea of "a beer" mesh with the FDA's published guidelines on "a serving" of alcohol?
		What <em>is</em> "a serving" of alcohol?</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>Well, <em>the FDA's</em> answer is that a serving of alcohol is strictly one of the following:
		1.5oz of 80 proof (40%) liquor, 5oz of 12% "table wine," or 12oz of 5% beer.  If you do the math, defining a drink
		as a flat, constant value volume of pure alcohol, then in terms of percentage all three of the FDA's serving
		recommendations are equivalent: the suggested beer, wine, and liquor serving sizes all contain
		<em>exactly</em> 0.6oz of pure alcohol.</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>But I can't remember the last time I saw a craft beer on the shelf that fell at, much less
		<em>under</em> 5% - the odd Berlinerweiss, honest session ale, or craft lager aside.
		For that matter, most of the wine I come across is over 12%, and plenty of liquors deviate from the
		FDA's simplistic 80 proof guideline.</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>So I wanted to know: when I buy a 22oz beer, and it's marked as having a seemingly reasonable
		6.8% ABV, how many servings are <em>really</em> in there?  How many servings of beer does that bottle provide?
		And what does it mean for your overall health if you have been drinking 22oz bottles of craft beer, thinking to
		yourself, "oh, I'll just have <em>a beer</em>"?</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>I finally sat down and did the (admittedly pretty simple) math one day, and the result caught
		me off guard.  It wasn't just that I had estimated incorrectly, but <em>how badly</em> wrong I was.  It's already
		easy enough to lose track of how much you've had when drinking, as it is; when you start thinking about the variety
		of serving sizes and ABV ratings out there on all these different brews, it's even easier to forget just how much
		it is you're drinking!</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>So I figured I'd put together a little tool to help you figure out just how heavy that
		bottle really is.  Just pop in a few quick values - volume of drink (could be beer or anything
		else, really) and ABV - and I'll tell you how many drinks you've got, along with a few other potentially
		useful tidbits.</p>
		<p class='formatted-paragraph'>I think you'll find the results... <em>sobering</em>.  ;)</p>
